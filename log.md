# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed #100daysofcode, setup Trello, Paper.

**Thoughts:** I felt like I didn't have any traction and was beating myself up about it. I am going to focus on actually doing what I want/need to do and not focus/worry about the past or situation I am in. Just focus on execution.

**Link to work:** Coming soon.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
